### Info

<details>
  <summary><b>Tech Stack</b></summary

Built using Solid.js <sup>[[1]](https://www.solidjs.com/)</sup> on the frontend (along with TS <sup>[[2]](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</sup> and SCSS <sup>[[3]](https://sass-lang.com/)</sup>), tested with Jest <sup>[[4]](https://jestjs.io/)</sup>, bundled with Vite <sup>[[5]](https://vitejs.dev/)</sup>. The data is stored using a Postgress <sup>[[6]](https://www.postgresql.org/)</sup> DB via Supabase <sup>[[7]](https://supabase.com/)</sup>, with the frontend deployed to Netlify <sup>[[8]](https://www.netlify.com/)</sup> and the code hosted on GitHub <sup>[[9]](https://github.com)</sup> and CI/CD workflows managed with GH Actions<sup>[[10]](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)</sup>.

  <summary><b>Future plans</b></summary
                                
I think it would be pretty fun to extend this, to automate as much of the process as possible. Based on snack ratings and user requests, use AI to generate a varied list of snacks that's within budget. Hook up to Slack to get approval from HR, use a supermarket API to make the order, generate the invoice and submit that to our companies expenses API, insert the arrival time into my calendar with Google API, and then collect employee snack feedback, and iterate for the next week.

That would basically be my whole job, automated.

## Deployment

To deploy the app, follow the [development instructions](#development) to get the code + dependencies, then run `yarn build` to build the production app, and use a web server of your choice to serve up the `/dist` directory.
You'll also need to deploy a Postgres DB, it's recommended to use Supabase. For setup instructions, see the [Data](#data-structures) section below.

The frontend can also be deployed to a static hosting provider of your choice. You can use the 1-click deploys below for Netlify or Vercel.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Netlify-%2330c8c9?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&labelColor=1e0e41 'Deploy CSO to Netlify, via 1-Click Script')](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/lissy93/cso)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Vercel-%23ffffff?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&labelColor=1e0e41)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FLissy93%2Fcso&env=VITE_SUPABASE_URL,VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY&envDescription=Login%20%2F%20create%20a%20Supabase%20account%2C%20then%20navigate%20to%20Settings%20--%3E%20API%20copy%20the%20URL%20and%20Anon%20API%20key%20&project-name=cso&repository-name=cso-fork)

## Development

- `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/cso.git && cd cso` - Grab the code
- `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `cp .env.sample .env` - Then paste your Supabase URL and anon key
- `yarn dev` - Start the dev server. Then pop open [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173)

You'll also need to create a Supabase project, and run the import script listed in [above](#data-structures).
